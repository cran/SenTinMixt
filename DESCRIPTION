Description: Implements parsimonious mixtures of MSEN and MTIN distributions via expectation-
    maximization based algorithms for model-based clustering. For each mixture
    component, parsimony is reached via the eigen-decomposition of the scale 
    matrices and by imposing a constraint on the tailedness parameter. This produces
    a family of 28 parsimonious mixture models for each distribution.
